# Hedi Fourati — Portfolio

Personal portfolio showcasing web projects, applications and experiments.

**[Visit the portfolio](https://www.thehnh.tech/)**

## Overview

The website brings together client websites, personal products, hackathons and a photo gallery. Project cards link to the relevant websites or App Store pages and indicate work that is still in development.

Built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion**. The layout adapts to smaller screens, supports light and dark themes, and respects reduced-motion preferences.
